# starkflare
This tool aims to monitor the resource usage of rollups in the StarkNet ecosystem, starting with StarkNet Mainnet. Its goal is to assist rollup developers in making their rollups cheaper, faster, and more efficient by providing real-time usage patterns of resources such as calldata, storage, and gas consumption. 

# collaborate with us on starkflare v1
Starkflare is initially built for teams working with technologies such as [Madara](https://www.madara.zone/) and [Dojo](https://dojoengine.com/en/). If you are interested in monitoring the resource usage of your rollup, game or dapp, reach out by submitting an Issue on this repository.
